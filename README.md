# Auto Output Path
A simple control panel for blender that helps to quickly create a meaningful output path for render output.

## Installation:
Place auto-output-path.py in your blender scripts folder and activate it in the user-preferences dialogue. More info on installing addons is available [here](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/scripting/introduction.html#installation).
The panel will appear on the render tab of blender's properties panel.

## Usage:
By default, the output filename will be in the format of
> \<project name\>_\<scene name\>

Options in the panel can be used to set the rendered images':
- Output folder
- Subfolder
- File Prefix
- File Suffix
- Number of placeholder digits

Tested with Blender 2.79b on Windows
